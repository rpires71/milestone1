            Over the years, I’ve pursued a wide range of certifications to complement my academic background in Computer
            Science and strengthen my role as an educator and IT professional. From foundational training in
            programming, networks, and web development in Portugal to earning globally recognised qualifications such as
            the CompTIA A+, ITF+, CCNA, and ECDL, each step has expanded my technical expertise. My PGCE and ongoing
            Level 5 Full Stack Web Development Diploma reflect a commitment to lifelong learning and professional
            growth. These certifications not only validate my knowledge but also enhance my ability to teach, lead, and
            innovate in education and IT.
