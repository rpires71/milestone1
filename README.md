# Personal Portfolio Website

## Purpose of the Website

As part of my **User-Centric Frontend Development â€“ Milestone Project 1**, a requirement for the Level 5 Diploma in Web Application Development, I have created this personal portfolio website.

The intended outcome of this project is to build a **responsive**, **accessible**, and **professionally presented** web application that serves a real-world purpose and incorporates user-centric design principles. Specifically, the website is designed as a professional platform showcasing my work as a private tutor and a Computer Science and Mathematics teacher/lecturer.

This website serves multiple related audiences:

- **Students:**  
  Explore resources, view examples of my work, and understand how I deliver learning experiences in Computer Science and Mathematics.

- **Education Providers and Employers:**  
  Learn about my teaching experience, qualifications, subject specialisms, and download a copy of my CV.

- **Parents and Guardians:**  
  Read student feedback, get in touch via the contact form, and evaluate my approach to teaching and tutoring.

## Key Features and Skills Demonstrated

The website highlights my experience as an educator while also showcasing my technical skills in front-end web development, including:

- Responsive design using CSS media queries and/or Bootstrap  
- Semantic, accessible HTML5 structure  
- Custom CSS styling  
- Clean, professional layout and intuitive navigation
