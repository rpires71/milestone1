## Colour Palette Justification for Portfolio Website

### Chosen Colour Palette

| Colour Name              | Hex Code   | Usage                                 |
|--------------------------|------------|----------------------------------------|
| Hazel Brown              | `#B7986B`  | Primary accents, buttons               |
| Gold Brown               | `#CBA135`  | Highlights, call-to-action elements    |
| Dark Chocolate Brown     | `#3E2C23`  | Headings, footer backgrounds           |
| Light Beige (Background) | `#F9F6F1`  | Main page background                   |
| Dark Grey / Dark Brown   | –          | Body text and headings                 |


### Overview and Rationale

To ensure accessibility and visual consistency that reflects my personal brand, my selected colour scheme is intended to create a warm, welcoming, and professional appearance. To support readability and user comfort across a range of devices, the brown and gold tones are paired with a neutral background.


### Justification

**Warm, Earthy Tones for Professional Appeal**

To convey a sense of reliability, the colour scheme is based on warm and earthy tones. I consider this approach appropriate for a professional portfolio—particularly in my case, which involves education and IT contexts where credibility and clarity are essential.

**High Contrast for Readability and Accessibility**

By adhering to WCAG accessibility standards and ensuring optimal colour contrast, the use of dark chocolate brown and dark grey text on a light beige background has been selected. This approach supports readability for users with visual impairments or cognitive processing challenges.

**Harmonious and Balanced Design**

By incorporating five core colours into the website, the approach follows the design ‘odd number rule’. This helps the interface remain both dynamic and visually appealing while maintaining a sense of balance and interest.

**Strategic Emphasis with Gold Accents**

For interactive elements such as highlights and call-to-action buttons, I have chosen Gold Brown (`#CBA135`). Without distracting or detracting from the overall content hierarchy, this approach provides clear visual focal points.

**Brand Consistency Across All Components**

The defined colour palette ensures that all design elements—including icons, interface components, and typographic styles—adhere to a cohesive standard. This contributes to a seamless and consistent browsing experience, reinforcing user familiarity and brand recognition.

### Applied Colour Theory Principles

**1. Warm Colour Psychology**

To create an environment of comfort and trust, this is supported by the use of warm tones such as brown and gold. For the target audience, which includes parents and employers in creative or IT-oriented sectors, these colour attributes are particularly effective.

**Monochromatic and Analogous Harmony**

To provide a sense of unity and prevent visual clutter, the scheme avoids conflicting colours, allowing users to focus on the content. Based on related hues on the colour wheel, hazel, chocolate, and gold browns form a visually harmonious combination.

**Neutral Base for Contrast**

To create a soft, non-intrusive foundation, a light beige background (`#F9F6F1`) is used. To support the legibility of foreground text and interface components, ample negative space is provided to allow the content to breathe.

**4. Accessibility Through Contrast**

Inclusive design is achieved through the use of dark brown or dark grey text, which provides strong contrast against the pale background. This approach ensures compliance with best practices for visual hierarchy and accessible communication in digital interfaces.

**5. Odd-Numbered Palette for Aesthetic Balance**

The five-colour palette—comprising a neutral background, two tonal browns, one gold accent, and a contrasting text colour—follows the principle of odd-numbered grouping. This enhances both visual harmony and functional clarity.

### Strategic Use of Colour

- **Emphasis**: To highlight key elements such as buttons, calls to action, or alerts, gold brown is applied selectively.
- **Hierarchy**: To support the reading flow, differentiation between headings (dark chocolate) and body text (dark grey) is implemented.
- **Consistency**: To establish a cohesive and refined appearance, every visual component across the site—including navigation, footers, and imagery—is styled in accordance with the defined palette.


### Summary

I believe my chosen colour scheme balances warmth, professionalism, and accessibility. The palette enhances user experience while reinforcing brand identity, and it is firmly grounded in established principles of colour theory and user interface design. Highly adaptable to responsive design frameworks such as Bootstrap and custom CSS, the natural tones also align with contemporary digital aesthetics.

This thoughtful application of colour not only reflects my professional ethos but also ensures an inclusive and engaging experience for all users.

## Typography Justification for Portfolio Website

### Overview

To ensure professionalism, clarity, and accessibility across a range of devices and target audiences, the typography for this portfolio website has been thoughtfully selected.

The target audience includes IT/web recruiters, education employers, students, and parents. After researching effective approaches that align with industry standards and also support a strong visual hierarchy, the chosen combination is **Montserrat** for headings and **Open Sans** for body text.

### Typography Goals

The above combination of typefaces was chosen due to being:

- Easy to read and accessible  
- Professional and trustworthy  
- Modern yet friendly  
- Fully responsive and readable on all screen sizes  

### Primary Typeface – Montserrat (Headings)

A widely used educational and tech-based web interface is the geometric, sans-serif typeface **Montserrat**. For section titles, headings and navigation items, its wide character spacing and structured design is ideal.

**Justification:**  
The Montserrat typeface conveys professionalism and clarity. It also supports visual hierarchy for fast content scanning. Furthermore, it performs consistently across desktop and mobile platforms and is well-suited to education and technology contexts.

### Secondary Typeface – Open Sans (Body Text)

For optimal reading comfort, **Open Sans**, a sans-serif typeface, is effective. Owing to its open structure and high x-height, it performs well for body text, CV content, project summaries, and extended written material.

**Justification:**  
The Open Sans typeface is optimised for on-screen legibility at smaller sizes. Moreover, it offers a neutral and friendly tone, appropriate for both academic and professional contexts. It is also highly accessible for users with dyslexia or visual processing difficulties, and helps to minimise eye strain and improve long-form readability.

### Implementation

Two typeface fonts will be used across the website to ensure consistency and performance.

### Typography specifications:

- Body text minimum size: `16px` (in line with accessibility standards)  
- Font weights: `400` for body content, `600–700` for headings  
- System fallback: `'Arial', sans-serif`  


### Accessibility and Compatibility

- Both **Montserrat** and **Open Sans** comply with **WCAG 2.1** guidelines for typographic contrast and legibility.  
- Fully supported across all major browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, and mobile platforms.  
- Delivered via the **Google Fonts CDN** for speed and reliability.  
- Option available to self-host for offline scenarios.  


### Alignment with Stakeholders

| **Stakeholder**         | **Typographic Benefit**                                                                 |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Students / Parents       | Open Sans provides clarity and a welcoming tone, fostering trust and readability.        |
| Education Employers      | Montserrat presents professionalism and structure, assisting in credential review.       |
| IT/Web Employers         | The modern sans-serif pairing demonstrates digital fluency and technical awareness.      |
| Developer (Site Owner)   | Straightforward to apply and maintain; supports responsive layouts on all devices.       |

### Summary

The combination of **Montserrat** and **Open Sans** forms a strong typographic system that:

- Improves readability, clarity, and user accessibility.  
- Projects a modern, confident, and professional visual tone.  
- Meets the needs of educational and technology-oriented audiences.  
- Supports consistent branding and responsive web design.  

This typography approach meets both the aesthetic goals and functional requirements for my portfolio website. It also contributes to a visually cohesive, inclusive, and engaging user experience.

## Accessibility Implementation and User Flow and Navigation Strategies

A crucial aspect of the development of this portfolio website is the implementation of accessibility features. To ensure the website is usable by the broadest possible audience, including users with visual, motor, auditory, and cognitive impairments, coding and design choices adhere to the **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1**.

### Key Accessibility Features

**Semantic HTML**  
To improve assistive technology interpretation and enhance screen reader compatibility, semantic elements such as `<header>`, `<main>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>` are incorporated into the website’s structure.
**Justification:** Semantic HTML promotes code clarity and optimises search engine visibility. In addition, by clearly identifying the function and structure of content, it enhances usability for assistive technologies and improves accessibility for screen reader users.

**Keyboard Navigation**  
We can implement via keyboard with visible focus indicators accessible interactive components such as forms, buttons, links, etc.  
**Justification:** Navigation without a mouse is achievable for users with motor disabilities or those utilising assistive equipment. Functionality and compliance with WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 2.1.1 (Keyboard Accessible) ensures clear tab sequencing and visible focus states.

**Colour Contrast**  
A contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 against their backgrounds is maintained with all text and interactive elements. This can be validated using tools such as the WebAIM Contrast Checker.  
**Justification:** In line with WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 1.4.3 (Contrast – Minimum), legibility for users with visual impairments, including low vision and colour vision deficiency, is ensured.

**Responsive Typography**  
To support text scaling in browser preferences and proportionally scaled headings, the minimum body text is set to 16px using scalable units (`rem`).  
**Justification:** Responsive typography respects user browser configurations for accessibility by ensuring text remains readable across all screen sizes. This supports users with dyslexia, older individuals, and those with cognitive disabilities.

**ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications)**  
With components such as alerts, interactive widgets, and forms, attributes such as `aria-label`, `aria-describedby`, and `role` are applied. This enhances context for assistive technologies including live regions and form inputs by assigning ARIA roles and labels where appropriate.  
**Justification:** Although semantic HTML addresses most requirements, it may be insufficient in scenarios where native elements lack clarity. In such cases, ARIA attributes provide supplementary context by improving screen reader interpretation and easing cognitive load.

**Alt Text and Descriptive Links**  
Meaningful descriptions such as “View Projects” instead of “Click Here” are implemented, and all images contain `alt` attributes.  
**Justification:** In line with WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 2.4.4 (Link Purpose) and 1.1.1 (Non-text Content), overall usability is enhanced and compatibility with screen reader technologies is supported.

**Form Accessibility**  
Using ARIA and semantic markup, accessible error notifications, real-time validation with clear messages, and labels included in forms can be implemented. Accessible design patterns are followed when forms provide clear error messaging and validation (e.g. using `aria-describedby` and inline feedback).  
**Justification:** Helps remove barriers in user interaction, such as correctly labelled forms with accessible error handling to support users with cognitive, motor, or visual impairments.

## User Flow and Navigation Strategy

I’ve planned to apply a clear, logical user flow designed to assist users of all backgrounds in achieving their objectives effectively and intuitively. By keeping user-focused interaction in mind, the website is structured with user-friendly navigation.

### Logic Flow

- **Homepage** introduces the site’s purpose and key actions such as presenting who I am, what I offer, and the main routes to explore further (e.g. Projects, Bookings).
- **About Me** page fosters user engagement and trust by outlining professional background.
- **Skills** page outlines information regarding the technical competencies acquired throughout my career.
- **Work Experience** page details the professional pathway throughout my career.
- **Certifications** page highlights key relevant achievements obtained throughout my career.
- **Projects** page will exhibit examples of professional expertise relevant to employer and student audiences.
- **Conferences and Workshops** page provides verification of additional training and current knowledge of up-to-date trends and competencies.
- **Bookings** page will feature a contact form for enquiries and may include the implementation of a live chat facility.

### Intended Enhancements

- For screen reader and keyboard users, the **Skip to Content** function will be integrated.
- A **responsive grid layout** will be implemented across tablets, mobile devices, and desktops to facilitate orientation and navigation, particularly for users utilising assistive technologies.
- A **consistent user interface** will be applied across all pages to support visual familiarity and reduce cognitive load.
- **Clear information architecture** will be used to enhance navigability; each section will be logically categorised and distinctly labelled.
- A **mobile- and tablet-first design** will be applied to ensure interfaces are fully responsive and tested across various screen sizes, prioritising readability, accessibility, and usability.

## Milestone 1: Project Setup with GitHub and Visual Studio Code

The following content documents the creation of the `milestone1` repository on GitHub and how Visual Studio Code (VS Code) was configured for day-to-day development.

### 1. Creation of the `milestone1` repository on GitHub

- **New repository:** On GitHub, click **New** (green button) → Repository name: `milestone1` (public).
- **Initialise:** Tick **Add a README**.
- **Add `.gitignore`:** No `.gitignore`.
- **Add license:** No license.
- **Create:** Click **Create repository** (green button).

**Result:** GitHub hosted an empty repository with a README on the `main` branch.

### 2. Connecting Visual Studio Code to the GitHub Repository (Using the VS Code Integrated Terminal)

- Opened my working folder in VS Code (**File → Open Folder**) and created/opened a `milestone1` directory.

- Opened **Terminal** (Command Prompt) and initialized Git:

  ```bash
  git init

- **Added and committed initial content locally:**

  ```bash
  git add README.md
  git commit -m "initial commit"

- **Pointed the local repo at the GitHub remote and aligned branch names:**

  ```bash
  git branch -M main
  git remote add origin https://github.com/rpires71/milestone1.git
  git push -u origin main

- **Verified the repository was connected:** `README.md` appeared in the VS Code Explorer, and pushes went to GitHub.

**Note:** From then on, my task-to-task loop to publish changes was:

```bash
git add .           # (Note the space: add everything in the folder)
git commit -m "descriptive message"
git push
```
### 3. Git identity setup (so commits show my name/email)

```bash
git config --global user.name "Roberto Pires"
git config --global user.email "roberto.pires@gmail.com"
git config --global init.defaultBranch main
```
### 4.	Local website verification during development (before deployment)

- Used Live Server in VS Code (right-click index.html → Open with Live Server), or
ran a quick local server via Python when needed:

```bash
 python -m http.server
```
- Then I opened http://localhost:8000 in the browser.

### 5.	Obstacles I encountered & how I solved them

**Error message 1: “No upstream branch” error on first push**
**Symptom:**
```bash
fatal: The current branch master has no upstream branch.
```
- **Cause:** My local branch wasn’t linked to any branch on the remote.
**Fix (option 1): Set the upstream explicitly:**
```bash
 	git push --set-upstream origin master
```
- **After this,** `git push/git pull` **works without extra arguments.**
**Fix (option 2 – align with GitHub’s default main): Rename the local branch first, then set upstream:**
```bash
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```
**Error message 2: Mismatch between `master` and `main`**
**Symptom: I had commits on `master` but the GitHub repo defaulted to `main`, or vice-versa.**
**Fix: Standardise on `main`, push it, and remove the old remote branch:**
```bash
git branch -m master main
git push -u origin main
git push origin --delete master
```
- **(Then, in GitHub → Settings → Branches, ensure Default branch = main.)**
  
**Error message 3:  Remote already had a README (divergent histories)**
**Symptom: Push rejected or instructions suggesting I pull first.**
- **Cause: I created a README on GitHub and also made a first local commit, so histories didn’t match.**
**Fix (when required): Pull and merge unrelated histories, then push:**
```bash
git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories
git push
```
**Verification of working fixes: “Did my push actually reach GitHub?”**
**Checks I used from the terminal:**
```bash
git status                      REM working tree clean?
git log --oneline               REM local history
git fetch
git log origin/main --oneline   REM remote history
git rev-parse HEAD
git rev-parse origin/main       REM compare SHAs; if equal, push succeeded
git remote -v                   REM confirm the remote URL
```
- **If using `git log` fullscreen, I exited with Q.**

### 6.	Why I used the terminal
- **I deliberately used VS Code’s integrated terminal (Command Prompt) to show CLI proficiency and keep a simple, reproducible workflow on any Windows machine—no extensions required for Git tasks.**

**Final state after Milestone 1**
- **A GitHub repo (`milestone1`) with `main` as the default branch.**
- **A local VS Code project linked to that repo via `origin`.**

**A repeatable commit/push loop:**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "message"
git push
```

- **A reliable way to preview locally (Live Server or `python -m http.server`) before deploying.**
- **Clear procedures to diagnose push issues and to fix branch/remote mismatches when they occur.**

### Justification  

To ensure that my workflow was consistent, effective, and aligned with professional standards, as well as to comply with the assignment requirements, GitHub and Visual Studio Code were deliberately selected for use in the **Milestone 1** project.  

Enabling secure storage of my project files and comprehensive visibility of my development history, I established a **centralised version control environment** which commenced with the creation of a remote repository on GitHub. A fundamental industry-standard practice for both collaborative and independent development projects, ensuring that every modification was documented with auditable commit messages, GitHub was initialised locally and connected to the remote.  

To demonstrate proficiency with the Git **command line interface (CLI)**, I opted to use the VS Code integrated terminal instead of graphical extensions. The workflow can be replicated in any professional context with a reduced dependency on plugins, while this approach is also transferable to other environments (*Linux, macOS, Windows*). Furthermore, my technical experience was enhanced by deepening my understanding of the underlying Git commands provided by the CLI.  

To my profile, ensuring all commits were attributed as accurately as possible, which justified the inclusion of identity configuration (`git config`). While potential employers and collaborators can clearly verify authorship on GitHub, accountability and professional branding practices are upheld.  

Ensuring issues could be identified and resolved before deployment, previewing the website locally through **Live Server** and `python -m http.server` was a standard practice. Broken links, layout inconsistencies, or accessibility issues being published were rectified, ensuring the project was safeguarded. Changes are validated in a staging environment before release when testing locally, which also reflects a professional development workflow.  

The obstacles I encountered—such as **mismatched branches** (`master` vs `main`), **missing upstream configurations**, and **divergent histories**—were opportunities to build resilience and problem-solving skills. For example, the *“no upstream branch”* error required me to investigate how local branches are linked to remote tracking branches. By learning to use commands such as:  

```bash
git push -u origin main
git branch -M main
```

### What I Checked (Desktop View + Link Targets)

**Menu items present on every page:**  
- Home  
- About Me  
- Work Experience  
- Skills  
- Certifications  
- Bookings  
- Contact  
- CV  
*(Source: [rpires71.github.io](https://rpires71.github.io))*


### Keyboard & Focus

- **Tab Order:**  
  Links are standard anchors, so they’re tabbable in logical order.

- **Focus Visibility:**  
  Relies on browser defaults. Recommend adding a clear outline for WCAG 2.4.7 compliance.  
  Following code was added to style.css file:

  ```css
  a:focus-visible {
    outline: 3px solid currentColor;
    outline-offset: 3px;
    text-decoration: underline;
    border-radius: 6px;
  }

### Proof - Link Testing (W3C Link Checker)

| Link Type      | Status in W3C Report  | Manual Check Result |
|----------------|------------------------|----------------------|
| tel:+447773554800 | N/A (scheme disabled) | Opens phone dialler correctly |
| mailto:roberto.pires@gmail.com | N/A (scheme disabled) | Opens default email client correctly |
| LinkedIn profile | Blocked by robots.txt | Link works in browser |
| Facebook profile | Blocked by robots.txt | Link works in browser |
| Instagram profile | Blocked by robots.txt | Link works in browser |

**Conclusion:** All navigation and contact links function as intended. Automated link checker reported only expected exclusions due to URI scheme and robots.txt restrictions.

<img width="398" height="290" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ce75462-8576-4ecd-99cc-b7dddf8d53bd" />

**What your W3C results mean**
- tel: and mailto: links → W3C link checker deliberately skips these for security reasons. It doesn’t mean they’re broken; it just means you need to test them manually (click them in the browser to confirm they open the dialler/email client).

- LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram → W3C could not check them because those sites’ robots.txt blocks automated crawlers. Again, this doesn’t mean they’re broken; you just need to confirm manually that the links load in the browser.

**Above links were tested manually on Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, Safari & Google Chrome including W3C Link Checker.**

  <tr>
    <td colspan="2"><strong>Observations and Improvements:</strong>

**Navigate to Bookings page**
- Page loads; form shows Name, Telephone, Email, Type of Service, Message, Submit.
  
**Submit with incomplete fields**
- Built-in HTML validation fires for Name and Email (both required).
- Type of Service is required, so users can submit with choosing one.
- Telephone and Message are optional.
  
**Invalid data (email)**
- **type="email"** triggers the browser’s native error bubble for invalid format.
- There are no inline error messages or ARIA live regions; errors rely on browser UI only (less consistent for screen readers).

**Valid entries + submit → confirmation**
- On success, the form redirects to **confirmation.html** (clear thank-you message + “Return to Homepage” button).
- **Important:** none of the form controls have a name attribute, so no user data is submitted (GET query will be empty). This is fine for a demo redirect, but no data will be captured by any backend/endpoint.

**Keyboard-only navigation**
- All fields and the button are focusable in logical order.
- Focus visibility appears to rely on browser defaults (acceptable but could be clearer with a site-wide :focus-visible style).

**Screen reader checks**
- Labels are correctly paired (<label for> + id) → fields are announced properly.
- No aria-describedby/inline error text; validation feedback may not be read reliably by SR users.

### Fix 1: Submit actual data + mark required fields
- **Add name and required (and a placeholder option) so values are sent and users must choose a service:**
- **Proof: Test Case TC002 improvement - Submit actual data + mark required fields**

### Fix 2: Accessible inline error messages
- **Add small, tied messages and announce them; keep browser validation**
- **Proof: Test Case TC002 improvement - Accessible inline error messages & Test Case TC002 improvement - Accessible inline error messages v2/v3**

### Re-test checklist (to close TC002 as PASS)
- Submitting empty form highlights Name, Email, Service with clear messages that are read by screen readers.
- Entering an invalid email shows/announces the message; valid email removes it.
- With all valid fields, you’re redirected to the confirmation page.
- Tab order is logical; a visible focus outline appears on each control.
- Using NVDA/VoiceOver: labels are announced; errors use role="alert"; the form-level role="status" announces status text.

- External links (icons): LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram. (No GitHub present.)
- Contact info: Direct mailto: email and a href tag to telephone numner.
- Plain text “Copyright © 2024 Roberto Pires”.
- Screen reader labelling — Link text is descriptive (e.g., “LinkedIn”, “About”).
- Social icons rely on i tag font-awesome glyphs.
- Aria-label is applied, and screen reader will announce “link” with context.

**Expected vs Actual**
- Internal links — N/A.
- External links are well-formed and have been confirmed for target="_blank" + rel="noopener noreferrer".
- Visual/keyboard focus — Works as expected.
- **Screen reader announcement — Text links fine, but icon-only social links need ARIA labels.**
- Broken/incorrect links — None found.
- **Hover feedback: Not a feature; site CSS removes underlines by default. For clear affordance, add an underline (or color shift with sufficient contrast) on :hover and :focus-visible in the footer.**
- **Keyboard tabbing & focus: Footer links are standard <a> elements - tabbable/activatable with Tab/Enter. Add/keep a strong visible focus indicator (site already uses :focus-visible elsewhere; extend it to footer links).**

- **Manual navigation:** Present (indicators + Prev/Next buttons) and OK.
- **Keyboard operability:** Buttons are real <button>s → tabbable/Enter-activatable. Arrow-key navigation works in Bootstrap when the carousel itself has focus; the buttons cover the core use case.
- **Alt text:** Present but generic (“Computer workspace image 1/2/3”). Include better text in <figcaption> but it’s visually hidden and not programmatically tied to the image.
- **ARIA on controls: aria-controls="hero-slider" references no element id (your carousel id is carouselExampleIndicators). Either fix to that id or remove aria-controls (Bootstrap doesn’t require it).**
- **Indicators:** Good (aria-label="Slide N"; active has aria-current="true").
- **Responsiveness:** CSS handles image sizing with object-fit: cover and mobile heights via media queries—good.
- **Reduced motion / flashing:** No flashing; transitions likely mild. No explicit reduced-motion override yet.

- **In-page anchor:** “Skills” points to the skills section (anchor on the Work Experience page), and the label is meaningful in context.
- **Footer social links:** Labeled as “LinkedIn”, “Facebook”, “Instagram” — clear, no “click here” patterns.

## Minor notes (nice-to-have)

- External links open in new tabs and have appending ARIA notes (e.g., aria-label="LinkedIn (opens in new tab)") purely for clarity.
- Title attributes are optional; focus on visible text staying descriptive (already good).

  - **Colour palette & typography:** Headings/body copy present with a uniform brown-and-gold palette and the same heading hierarchy across pages (hero heading + section headings).
  - **Spacing & modules:** Repeated “tile/card” styling and consistent spacing around sections (e.g., contact tiles, skills/experience blocks).
  - **Buttons/links:** Buttons follow the same accent style (e.g., Bookings “Submit” matches the accent), nav links are consistent in wording and placement. (Minor: one button uses inline color—consider a shared .btn-accent class everywhere.)
  - **Icons & imagery:** Reused iconography set and image treatment across pages (contact/social icons; section logos).
  - **Responsive intent:** Layout patterns appear consistent; carousel and grids imply responsive behavior, inlcuding tablet/mobile verification.

### Recommendations to keep it rock-solid

- Extract all button colours into the existing .btn-accent / .btn-outline-accent classes (avoid inline styles) so every button gets identical hover/focus states site-wide.
- Ensure footer/nav link hover/focus affordances are consistent (underline on :hover and :focus-visible).

    <td colspan="2"><strong>Actual Result:</strong>
      
- **Pages reviewed:** Home, About Me, Work Experience & Skills, Certifications, Bookings, Confirmation. Content renders and headings/body text are present as expected.
- **Typeface & hierarchy:** Headings (Montserrat) are clearly larger/heavier than body (Open Sans). Good visual separation.
- **Base size:** Default body text appears around the browser default (≈16px), which is fine. However, some sections use smaller, clamped sizes (from your shared CSS) that can drop below 16px on small screens (e.g., .header-intro min 0.75rem; .tile text capped at 0.9rem with a minimum 0.5rem). That’s too small for comfortable reading.
- **Line spacing:** Several blocks use line-height: 1.4; others fall back to the browser’s “normal” (≈1.2). The test calls for ~1.5×—some sections don’t meet this consistently.
- **Contrast:** Body copy #3a1705 on #f9f6f1 is excellent (well above 4.5:1). Button text #f9f6f1 on the accent background #b7986b is around ~3:1, which is below 4.5:1 for normal-size text (fails WCAG 1.4.3 for small text).
- **Zoom:** Structure should hold at 200%, but with the small cap on tile/body sizes, some text may still feel tight; increase minimums.
- **Dark mode:** Not applicable (no dark theme).

  **Meets the intent of WCAG 2.1 SC 1.3.1 (Info and Relationships) and SC 4.1.2 (Name, Role, Value). Optional future hardening: add a live region for carousel slide change announcements when controls are focused.**
  **Improvements:** I've decided to replace the default blue focus ring and use an on-brand, accessible focus style for the Bookings form fields.
  - Because I'm using Bootstrap, I've overrided its :focus border/box-shadow. The safest (and WCAG-friendly) choice from the website palette is the dark chocolate (#3e2c23, --headings-footer-background). The gold/hazel accents don't reach the 3:1 non-text contrast needed for focus indicators.
  - **Contrast:** #3e2c23 on the light background exceeds 3:1 for non-text contrast (WCAG 2.2 SC 1.4.11). The gold/hazel accents don't meet 3:1 for a thin border.
  - **Focus visibility:** A thicker ring (border + outer glow) is clearly perceivable for keyboard users (SC 2.4.7).
  - **Doesn't rely on color alone:** The ring adds a shape/weight change (thicker stroke), improving perception for color-vision deficiency.
  - **Works with Bootstrap:** !important ensures your focus styles win over Bootstrap’s default blue.

  ### 2nd Test results after Fix 1
  **Pages reviewed: Home, About Me, Work Experience & Skills, Certifications, Bookings, Confirmation.**
  - A “Skip to content” link is implemented as the first focusable element and targets the page’s <main> region (visible on first Tab, activates with Enter).
  - Focus moves to <main> without being hidden by the sticky navbar (offset handled), and a visible focus outline is shown.
  - Behaviour is consistent on Home, About Me, Work Experience & Skills, Certifications, and Bookings pages.
  - Meets intent of WCAG 2.1 – SC 2.4.1 (Bypass Blocks).

### Fix 1: Visible “Skip to content” link appears as the first focusable element on page load on the reviewed pages.**
- **Fix (minimal, accessible pattern).**
- **Proof: Test Case TC024 - Skip to content section added to all pages and additional CSS.**

  ### PASS (2nd attempt after Fix 1)
  **A visible “Skip to content” link appears as the first focusable element, activates with Enter, and programmatically moves focus to the page’s main tag region (not obscured by the sticky navbar). The link is announced clearly by assistive tech and behaves consistently across pages—meeting WCAG 2.1 SC 2.4.1 (Bypass Blocks).**

- All pages should load fully in under 3 seconds on standard broadband and 4G mobile connections.<br>
- All visual elements (e.g. headers, text, images, image sliders) and interactive components (buttons, links) should render without delay or visual glitches.<br>
- Performance score from Google Lighthouse or PageSpeed Insights should be above 85% for both desktop and mobile views.<br>

</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2"><strong>Actual Result:</strong>
      
  **Pages tested: Home, About Me, Work Experience & Skills, Certifications, Bookings, Confirmation.**
  - **Perceived load:** All pages render promptly; nav, hero content (incl. carousel), and footer appear without jank or blocking, and interactions are ready quickly.
  - **Assets:** Pages are lightweight with minimal JS (Bootstrap pattern) and compressed WebP images; content paints fast and remains stable.
  - **Inner pages:** About, Work Experience & Skills, Certifications, Bookings and Confirmation exhibit similarly fast first paint and no layout shifts.

  **Notes (optional hardening):**
  - Consider replacing Google Fonts @import with <link rel="preconnect"> + <link rel="stylesheet"> in <head> to trim render delay, and add loading="lazy" to non-critical images (e.g., footer images or non-active carousel slides).

### Test Note 1 — Using Lighthouse Timespan for the Skills section (work-experience.html#skills)
### Date: 20 Aug 2025
### Page under test: work-experience.html (Skills subsection)

**Why Timespan was required**
- Running Lighthouse in Navigation mode directly against the hash URL (work-experience.html#skills) produced an incomplete trace (e.g., missing LCP/TBT, odd "NO_LCP" in the export).
- **Reason:** a hash link changes in-page state without a full navigation. Navigation audits are optimised for page loads from a URL, not for user-initiated scrolling into sections after load. The recording started from an already-loaded document, so key "page load" metrics were undefined.
- To accurately measure the user interaction of moving to and rendering the Skills section, Lighthouse Timespan mode is more appropriate because it records a slice of user activity (scrolling/interaction) rather than only the initial navigation.

**What I did**
- **1. Ran a standard Navigation audit on work-experience.html (no hash) to capture baseline SEO/Best Practices/Accessibility/Performance for the page load.**
- **2. Ran a Timespan audit:**
- Start recording on work-experience.html.
- Navigate (Tab/Enter or click) to Skills (#skills) and wait for the section to settle.
- Stop recording to capture layout stability and responsiveness for that interaction.

**Outcomes / Notes**
- Timespan provided reliable metrics for the Skills section interaction (CLS, responsiveness) where Navigation (via hash) did not.
- One actionable finding surfaced consistently: images without intrinsic dimensions (no width/height) can cause small layout shifts. I added width/height (or aspect-ratio) to relevant images and re-tested to confirm reduced CLS for that flow.

**How this fits the test plan**
- Navigation mode remains the source of truth for full page loads.
- Timespan mode supplements the plan for in-page flows (e.g., jumping to #skills), ensuring realistic, user-centred performance measures for sections that are revealed post-load.

### Test Note 2 — Using Lighthouse Timespan for all Contact sections (#contact)
### Date: 20 Aug 2025
### Sections under test: Footer Contact section (#contact) on all pages

**Why Timespan was required**
- The Contact area is a section within each page, not a separate URL. Jumping to #contact (via the navbar link) does not trigger a full page navigation.
- Lighthouse Navigation mode focuses on initial page load. When started from or navigated to a hash target, Navigation runs can produce incomplete page-load metrics (e.g., missing LCP) because no new document load occurs.
- Lighthouse Timespan mode records a slice of user interaction (e.g., clicking “Contact” in the navbar, smooth-scroll into the footer, content settling). This captures layout stability and responsiveness for the in-page transition I actually care about.

**Method**
- **1. Open page (e.g., index.html) with DevTools → Lighthouse.**
- **2. Run a Navigation audit once (baseline page load).**
- **3. Switch to Timespan mode:**
- Start recording.
- Activate the Contact navbar link (or press Tab to it and Enter).
- Let the page smooth-scroll to #contact and settle (accounting for sticky navbar offset).
- Stop recording.
- **4. Repeat steps on all listed pages and viewports (Desktop & Mobile throttles).**

**What the Timespan captured**
- CLS during the scroll and reveal of the footer tiles.
- Interactivity/latency while the section becomes visible (INP/TBT proxies in the report).
- Any image/icon loading shifts within the footer (e.g., social icons, badge).
- Confirmation that focus/active state changes (IntersectionObserver highlighting “Contact”) do not introduce jank.

**Outcomes / Notes**
- Timespan runs gave reliable, repeatable metrics for the in-page Contact transition, where Navigation mode would not.
- Minor layout shifts were observed initially and mitigated by adding intrinsic image dimensions / aspect-ratio and ensuring consistent focus styles.
- No significant performance regressions across pages; the Contact section remains stable, accessible, and responsive after adjustments.

**Fit with the test plan**
- Navigation audits remain the baseline for full page loads.
- Timespan audits are used for section-level UX flows (like #contact) to reflect real user behaviour and ensure performance/accessibility at the moment of interaction.

    <td><strong>Feature:</strong> Optimised images
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2"><strong>Description:</strong> Verify that all images across the website are appropriately compressed and sized for fast loading without sacrificing visual quality. Formats like WebP or properly scaled JPEG/PNG should be used.
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2"><strong>Justification:</strong> Optimised images reduce page load time and bandwidth usage, contributing to better performance scores and an improved user experience—especially for users on slower connections. It also supports accessibility and SEO best practices.

    <td colspan="2"><strong>Steps:</strong><br>
1. Open website pages containing multiple images (e.g. homepage, projects, about).<br>
2. Use browser developer tools to inspect image file sizes and formats.<br>
3. Run performance tests using tools like Google Lighthouse or PageSpeed Insights.<br>
4. Confirm images load correctly and maintain visual quality across devices.<br>
5. Ensure no oversized or uncompressed image files are present.<br>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2"><strong>Expected Result:</strong><br>
- All images should load quickly, appear sharp, and be under appropriate file size limits (generally <500KB per image). No unnecessary large images or format warnings should be flagged in performance testing tools.
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2"><strong>Actual Result:</strong>
  
  **Pages reviewed: Home, About Me, Work Experience & Skills, Certifications, Bookings, Confirmation.**
  - **Formats:** All page imagery I could inspect is delivered as WebP; social/iconography is SVG. This is ideal for performance. Examples:
  - Home: header logo logolbg3.webp, carousel images homeCarousel1v3.webp, homeCarousel2v3.webp, homeCarousel3v3.webp.
  - About: about-illustration2.webp and section thumbnails (WebP).
  - Work Experience/Skills: multiple section images in WebP.
  - Certifications: all badge/logo images as WebP.
  - Bookings: page logo in WebP.
  - **Visual quality:** Images render crisp at typical desktop/tablet/mobile sizes; no obvious upscaling artifacts observed.
  - **No obvious legacy JPG/PNG content images:** Favicons remain small PNGs, which is normal and fine.

  - The "Contact" anchor targets the footer section consistently. A visible "Skip to content" link is present at the very top (first tabbable element).
  - **Content & media:**
  - Home carousel renders with indicators and previous/next controls; each slide image has descriptive alt text.
  - Images and copy load correctly across pages; no obvious broken assets observed.
  - **Forms (Bookings):**
  - Form shows required markers and inline guidance (e.g., "Enter a valid email address." / "Please choose a service."). Submits to confirmation.html via GET.
  - **External resources:**
  - CV (PDF) link works and opens the correct file.
  - Social links (LinkedIn/Facebook/Instagram) point to the right destinations. (Target/rel attributes aren't visible in this rendered view; recommend keeping target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" in markup.)
  - **Responsiveness & consistency:**
  - Layout/typography/colour palette appear consistent across pages; cards/tiles/footers preserve the same look-and-feel. No horizontal overflow noticed.
