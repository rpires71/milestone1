## Colour Palette Justification for Portfolio Website

### Chosen Colour Palette

| Colour Name              | Hex Code   | Usage                                 |
|--------------------------|------------|----------------------------------------|
| Hazel Brown              | `#B7986B`  | Primary accents, buttons               |
| Gold Brown               | `#CBA135`  | Highlights, call-to-action elements    |
| Dark Chocolate Brown     | `#3E2C23`  | Headings, footer backgrounds           |
| Light Beige (Background) | `#F9F6F1`  | Main page background                   |
| Dark Grey / Dark Brown   | –          | Body text and headings                 |


### Overview and Rationale

To ensure accessibility and visual consistency that reflects my personal brand, my selected colour scheme is intended to create a warm, welcoming, and professional appearance. To support readability and user comfort across a range of devices, the brown and gold tones are paired with a neutral background.


### Justification

**Warm, Earthy Tones for Professional Appeal**

To convey a sense of reliability, the colour scheme is based on warm and earthy tones. I consider this approach appropriate for a professional portfolio—particularly in my case, which involves education and IT contexts where credibility and clarity are essential.

**High Contrast for Readability and Accessibility**

By adhering to WCAG accessibility standards and ensuring optimal colour contrast, the use of dark chocolate brown and dark grey text on a light beige background has been selected. This approach supports readability for users with visual impairments or cognitive processing challenges.

**Harmonious and Balanced Design**

By incorporating five core colours into the website, the approach follows the design ‘odd number rule’. This helps the interface remain both dynamic and visually appealing while maintaining a sense of balance and interest.

**Strategic Emphasis with Gold Accents**

For interactive elements such as highlights and call-to-action buttons, I have chosen Gold Brown (`#CBA135`). Without distracting or detracting from the overall content hierarchy, this approach provides clear visual focal points.

**Brand Consistency Across All Components**

The defined colour palette ensures that all design elements—including icons, interface components, and typographic styles—adhere to a cohesive standard. This contributes to a seamless and consistent browsing experience, reinforcing user familiarity and brand recognition.

### Applied Colour Theory Principles

**1. Warm Colour Psychology**

To create an environment of comfort and trust, this is supported by the use of warm tones such as brown and gold. For the target audience, which includes parents and employers in creative or IT-oriented sectors, these colour attributes are particularly effective.

**Monochromatic and Analogous Harmony**

To provide a sense of unity and prevent visual clutter, the scheme avoids conflicting colours, allowing users to focus on the content. Based on related hues on the colour wheel, hazel, chocolate, and gold browns form a visually harmonious combination.

**Neutral Base for Contrast**

To create a soft, non-intrusive foundation, a light beige background (`#F9F6F1`) is used. To support the legibility of foreground text and interface components, ample negative space is provided to allow the content to breathe.

**4. Accessibility Through Contrast**

Inclusive design is achieved through the use of dark brown or dark grey text, which provides strong contrast against the pale background. This approach ensures compliance with best practices for visual hierarchy and accessible communication in digital interfaces.

**5. Odd-Numbered Palette for Aesthetic Balance**

The five-colour palette—comprising a neutral background, two tonal browns, one gold accent, and a contrasting text colour—follows the principle of odd-numbered grouping. This enhances both visual harmony and functional clarity.

### Strategic Use of Colour

- **Emphasis**: To highlight key elements such as buttons, calls to action, or alerts, gold brown is applied selectively.
- **Hierarchy**: To support the reading flow, differentiation between headings (dark chocolate) and body text (dark grey) is implemented.
- **Consistency**: To establish a cohesive and refined appearance, every visual component across the site—including navigation, footers, and imagery—is styled in accordance with the defined palette.


### Summary

I believe my chosen colour scheme balances warmth, professionalism, and accessibility. The palette enhances user experience while reinforcing brand identity, and it is firmly grounded in established principles of colour theory and user interface design. Highly adaptable to responsive design frameworks such as Bootstrap and custom CSS, the natural tones also align with contemporary digital aesthetics.

This thoughtful application of colour not only reflects my professional ethos but also ensures an inclusive and engaging experience for all users.

## Accessibility Implementation and User Flow and Navigation Strategies

A crucial aspect of the development of this portfolio website is the implementation of accessibility features. To ensure the website is usable by the broadest possible audience, including users with visual, motor, auditory, and cognitive impairments, coding and design choices adhere to the **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1**.

### Key Accessibility Features

**Semantic HTML**  
To improve assistive technology interpretation and enhance screen reader compatibility, semantic elements such as `<header>`, `<main>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>` are incorporated into the website’s structure.
**Justification:** Semantic HTML promotes code clarity and optimises search engine visibility. In addition, by clearly identifying the function and structure of content, it enhances usability for assistive technologies and improves accessibility for screen reader users.

**Keyboard Navigation**  
We can implement via keyboard with visible focus indicators accessible interactive components such as forms, buttons, links, etc.  
**Justification:** Navigation without a mouse is achievable for users with motor disabilities or those utilising assistive equipment. Functionality and compliance with WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 2.1.1 (Keyboard Accessible) ensures clear tab sequencing and visible focus states.

**Colour Contrast**  
A contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 against their backgrounds is maintained with all text and interactive elements. This can be validated using tools such as the WebAIM Contrast Checker.  
**Justification:** In line with WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 1.4.3 (Contrast – Minimum), legibility for users with visual impairments, including low vision and colour vision deficiency, is ensured.

**Responsive Typography**  
To support text scaling in browser preferences and proportionally scaled headings, the minimum body text is set to 16px using scalable units (`rem`).  
**Justification:** Responsive typography respects user browser configurations for accessibility by ensuring text remains readable across all screen sizes. This supports users with dyslexia, older individuals, and those with cognitive disabilities.

**ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications)**  
With components such as alerts, interactive widgets, and forms, attributes such as `aria-label`, `aria-describedby`, and `role` are applied. This enhances context for assistive technologies including live regions and form inputs by assigning ARIA roles and labels where appropriate.  
**Justification:** Although semantic HTML addresses most requirements, it may be insufficient in scenarios where native elements lack clarity. In such cases, ARIA attributes provide supplementary context by improving screen reader interpretation and easing cognitive load.

**Alt Text and Descriptive Links**  
Meaningful descriptions such as “View Projects” instead of “Click Here” are implemented, and all images contain `alt` attributes.  
**Justification:** In line with WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 2.4.4 (Link Purpose) and 1.1.1 (Non-text Content), overall usability is enhanced and compatibility with screen reader technologies is supported.

**Form Accessibility**  
Using ARIA and semantic markup, accessible error notifications, real-time validation with clear messages, and labels included in forms can be implemented. Accessible design patterns are followed when forms provide clear error messaging and validation (e.g. using `aria-describedby` and inline feedback).  
**Justification:** Helps remove barriers in user interaction, such as correctly labelled forms with accessible error handling to support users with cognitive, motor, or visual impairments.

## User Flow and Navigation Strategy

I’ve planned to apply a clear, logical user flow designed to assist users of all backgrounds in achieving their objectives effectively and intuitively. By keeping user-focused interaction in mind, the website is structured with user-friendly navigation.

### Logic Flow

- **Homepage** introduces the site’s purpose and key actions such as presenting who I am, what I offer, and the main routes to explore further (e.g. Projects, Bookings).
- **About Me** page fosters user engagement and trust by outlining professional background.
- **Skills** page outlines information regarding the technical competencies acquired throughout my career.
- **Work Experience** page details the professional pathway throughout my career.
- **Certifications** page highlights key relevant achievements obtained throughout my career.
- **Projects** page will exhibit examples of professional expertise relevant to employer and student audiences.
- **Conferences and Workshops** page provides verification of additional training and current knowledge of up-to-date trends and competencies.
- **Bookings** page will feature a contact form for enquiries and may include the implementation of a live chat facility.

### Intended Enhancements

- For screen reader and keyboard users, the **Skip to Content** function will be integrated.
- A **responsive grid layout** will be implemented across tablets, mobile devices, and desktops to facilitate orientation and navigation, particularly for users utilising assistive technologies.
- A **consistent user interface** will be applied across all pages to support visual familiarity and reduce cognitive load.
- **Clear information architecture** will be used to enhance navigability; each section will be logically categorised and distinctly labelled.
- A **mobile- and tablet-first design** will be applied to ensure interfaces are fully responsive and tested across various screen sizes, prioritising readability, accessibility, and usability.
